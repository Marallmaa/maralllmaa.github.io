                    <p> "I have known true alchemists," the alchemist continued. "They locked themselves in their laboratories,
                        and tried to evolve, as gold had. And they found the Philosopher's Stone, because they understood that 
                        when something evolves, everything around that thing evolves as well."</p>
                    <p> "Others stumbled upon the stone by accident. They already had the gift, and their souls were readier for 
                        such things than the souls of others.But they don't count. They're quite rare."</p>
                    <p> "And then there were the others, who were interested only in gold. They never found the secret. They 
                        forgot that lead, copper , and iron have their own destinies to fulfill. And anyone who interferes with the
                        destiny of another thing never will discover his own." ...</p>
